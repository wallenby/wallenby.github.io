                    <h3>Neural Network Autoencoder for Styling Images</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Ever since I started working with A.I. and Neural Networks, I've been fascinated by different projects I could work on using those
                        tools, and of course, those ideas were related to photographs. Specifically, 35mm and medium format photos. Film photos have a very 
                        distinct look to them which gives them a special sort of charm, but it's often difficult to duplicate or replicate this look using
                        digital cameras; They're just not quite the same. This is where my next idea came into play!

                        <br><br>

                        An auto-encoder that uses a Neural Network to try and learn the pattern present in 35mm and Medium Format photos and that can
                        apply this look to new digital images! This project is still a work in progress and has proven to be more difficult than expected,
                        mainly due to the computing power needed to run the Neural Network. My current set up doesn't have enough VRAM for the size
                        of the images that I need to train, which has caused a couple of hiccups along the way when attempting to put this project together.

                        <br><br>

                        This is still a work in progress, but I'm working on it from time to time and will keep posting updates here!
