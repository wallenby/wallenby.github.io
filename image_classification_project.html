                    <h3>Image Focus Recognition and Classification Neural Network </h3>
                    <p>
                        Photographs are used to capture and record detailed still moments of different scenarios, environments or subjects for a wide variety of 
                        purposes. For example, taking a high quality picture of a large celestial body, like the moon in order to see and study its craters for 
                        scientific research, to even capturing microscopic images of tiny micro-organisms to study how they interact with their surrounding 
                        world, to even just capturing a special moment in a person's life, like a wedding, or a vacation. Regardless of the application of the 
                        images, it is important to capture as much detail as possible, but this detail can be lost when the image is out-of-focus; Not only that, 
                        it could also render the image unusable. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        Machine learning has been used in the past not only for binary classification of in- and 
                        out-of-focus images, but also the classification of different kinds of blur. The goal for this project was to classify images that 
                        are in-focus and out-of-focus using Neural Networks. This could have useful applications in a camera focusing system, aiding in either 
                        manually focusing the lens, or having it connected to a motorised focusing system and adjusting focus automatically.
