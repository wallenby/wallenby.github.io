            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Erik Menard, and I'm recent Computer Science graduate from Carleton University.
                I'm a sucker for learning and experimenting with new technologies and setting projects for myself! :) I love working on
                challenging tasks which get me to try new concepts and techniques that ultimately get me to learn new skills.
                In this portfolio I've included my favourite projects that I've worked on, and I've divided them into 3 categories: 
                Programming, Photography and Drawings

                <br><br>

                <h3><a href="programming.html">Programming</a></h3>
                <p>
                The programming section includes all my Programming/Computer/Tech related projects which I've been working on! This includes my project for building
                my own camera, designing Neural Networks for different tasks and some other fun projects that I've made! 
                </p>

                <h3><a href="photography.html">Photography</a></h3>
                <p>
                Here I've posted some of my favourite photos which I've taken! There's some astro-photography as well as some landscape photos!
                </p>

                <h3><a href="drawings.html">Drawings</a></h3>
                <p>
                I like to doodle on my free time and I figured I'd include some of my favourite doodles heres! :)
