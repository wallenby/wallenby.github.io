            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>Here's where I showcase my coding projects! From A.I. to custom made digital cameras!
                I love to tinker with different bits of technology while learning, exploring and trying new things :) </p>

                    <h3>Custom Camera Project</h3>
                    <p>I love photography and cameras! I've always been fascinated with the way old and new cameras worked.
                        I read and learned about all their inner workings on my free team because I was so entriguied as to how they worked!
                        I'm also a big sucker for making projects with the Raspberry Pi, so when I saw that the Pi foundation made a high
                        quality camera module, I knew what my next big project was gonna be.
                        I started off by putting the parts I needed together.
                       
                        <ul> 
                            <br><li>
                        A computer to run everything (the Raspberry Pi 4) </li>
                        <li> sensor - The HQ Camera Module   </li>
                        <li>A screen to see what's the sensor is seeing  </li>
                        <li>A battery, otherwise I'd be limited to indoor usage.  </li>
                        <li>Buttons to control the screen since bringing a keyboard around to type lines into the terminal wasn't my idea of practical  </li>
                        <li>A case to hold everything.  </li>
                        <br>
                      
                    </ul>

            <p>I love slowing down and looking at things more deeply through camera lenses. This includes landscapes, scenes, people and even the moon! </p>
